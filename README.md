# ChessGDX
**THE** Chess game made in LibGDX! *(Currently in development)*

**Understanding the branches**

The [ChessGDX/main](https://github.com/arencoskun/ChessGDX/tree/main) branch is for stable and *generally* old versions as the newer versions tend to be extremely buggy.

The [ChessGDX/dev](https://github.com/arencoskun/ChessGDX/tree/dev) branch is for half-stable and *generally* newer versions.

The [ChessGDX/multiplayer](https://github.com/arencoskun/ChessGDX/tree/multiplayer) branch is archived. See [the README](https://github.com/arencoskun/ChessGDX/blob/multiplayer/README.md) for more information.

The [ChessGDX/multiplayer-v2](https://github.com/arencoskun/ChessGDX/tree/multiplayer-v2) branch is for the multiplayer rewrite. *Currently*, it is not very stable.
